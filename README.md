To run the application make sure you have Gradle plug-in integrated with your Eclipse (sorry I do not provide instructions to other IDEs) and you perform the following steps:
1. Click on "Run" menu
2. Select "Run configurations..." menu item
3. Double click the "Gradle project"
4. In "Gradle Tasks" field put the following command: `desktop:run`
5. In "Working Directory" field put the following entry `${workspace_loc:/libgdx-progress-bar-example}`
6. Click on "Run" button

The components are packed using the Texture-Packer GUI: [https://code.google.com/archive/p/libgdx-texturepacker-gui/downloads]

The graphical components for the LoadingBarWithBorders are taken from: [http://www.freepik.com/free-psd/loading-progress-bar-icon-layered-psd_688020.htm]
